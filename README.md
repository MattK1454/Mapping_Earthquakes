# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview

This project was designed to construct a map displaying earthquakes around the world over the past 7 days. It was adjusted to allow for data visualization that would communicate data regarding each quake as well as filter for the major quakes (magnitude > 5), display the tectonic paltes, and allow for 3 map style variations through which the data can be viewed.

## Results/Summary

![Base Map](https://github.com/MattK1454/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/images/base_map.png)
Base map for displaying earthquake data.

![Satellite Map](https://github.com/MattK1454/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/images/satellite_map.png)
Satellite style map.

![Dark Map](https://github.com/MattK1454/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/images/dark_map.png)
Dark style map.

![Dark Map with tectonic plates and major quakes](https://github.com/MattK1454/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/images/dark_map_major_plates.png)

The images above were created using the overlay and map selection features coded into the site. By pulling data in a GeoJSON format and parsing it for the necessary information, these maps can be viewed.
